**Problem statement**
Explain what the following code is attempting to do? You can explain by:
1. Explaining how the highlighted constructs work?
2. Giving use-cases of what these constructs could be used for.
3. What is the significance of the for loop with 4 iterations?
4. What is the significance of make(chan func(), 10)?
5. Why is “HERE1” not getting printed?

```
package main
import "fmt";

func main() {
    cnp := make(chan func(), 10)
    for i := 0; i &lt; 4; i++ {
        go func() {
            for f := range cnp {
                f()
            }
        }()
    }
    cnp <- func() {
        fmt.Println("HERE1")
    }
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}
```

**Solution**
1. The code begins by creating a buffered channel named `cnp` of type `chan func()` with a buffer size of `10`. Then a for loop is used to create four goroutines. Inside each goroutine, an anonymous function is defined. These goroutines will run concurrently. Within each goroutine, there is an inner loop that continuously receives functions from the cnp channel and immediately executes them. In the main function, a function literal that prints "HERE1" is sent to the cnp channel. This function is executed by one of the goroutines when it receives it from the channel. Concurrently, the main function prints "Hello." The final output will be "Hello".

2. Goroutines enable the parallel execution of tasks, making it suitable for scenarios like handling multiple requests in a web server concurrently. 
Channels facilitate communication and synchronization between different parts of a program that run concurrently, ensuring data consistency.
Buffered channels, like cnp := make(chan func(), 10), are useful as buffered queues for decoupling producers and consumers, allowing for controlled asynchronous processing. 
Function literals, or closures, can serve as callbacks, allowing you to specify custom behavior to be executed when an asynchronous operation completes.

3. The for loop with 4 iterations enables concurrent and potentially parallel execution of tasks, improving the program's performance and responsiveness, especially in scenarios where multiple tasks need to be handled simultaneously.

4. `make(chan func(), 10)` sets up a buffered channel that allows the concurrent execution of functions across multiple goroutines while providing a degree of asynchrony and synchronization. The buffer size of 10 provides flexibility in terms of queuing functions for execution. If the channel is full (contains 10 functions), the sender will block until there is room in the channel. This can help control the rate of function execution and prevent excessive memory usage.

5. This is because the program terminatea before the goroutines have processed the function. One of the way to make this work is using `sync.WaitGroup` to wait for the goroutines to finish their work.
